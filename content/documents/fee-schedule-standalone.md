Below are links to my fee schedule for interfering with my rights. The United States of America is a Common Law country, the government obtains its permission to govern from the governed; by the people, of the people, and from the people.

As such government shall not make any law or rule that has the force of law without the consent of the governed. But when it happens you have to hold the man (not the office) to account. You do this by requiring the man that is interfering with your rights to pay fees at any time you are compelled to perform on a law or rule that has the force of law that gives the man consent to perform that action until a contract is produced, or a man or a women produces are claim or complaint that they have been harmed by your actions. Sometimes consent is assumed, sometimes you actual gave consent though a document you signed. This fee schedule prevents any ambiguities that most men or women who hide behind an office operate under.

This my fee schedule for my own use, but you can freely use it as long as you remove all the styles, and personally identifying information and put your own in it. I use a seal as there is a certain cosmic reason for I will not go into now. I suggest you learn how to defend your rights otherwise you will not know how to respond to a challenge to your rights.
