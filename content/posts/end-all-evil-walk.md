I have decided that I am going to walk to show support for ending all evil. In my view ending evil involves moving support and authority from outside institutions like the police and government to the individual or group of individuals. This does not mean that we give up order and create lawlessness. As a matter of fact the people of Spain were able to operate without a government or police durring the [Spainish Revolution of 1936](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Revolution_of_1936) before getting taking over by other countries. There were some issues due to revolutionaries forcing non-revolutionaries to go along with the program. Obviously we don't want to force anyone to do anything against their will. So I see that part of it a failure.

Institutions like our governments and the media have become political establishments that work to remove individual value. Everything we are and do is because of our individual value. In my humble opinion, if we give up our individuality on behalf of a majority we lose what it means to be human and the majority and all of its machinations take precedence over doing what is right for principal sake. Henry David Thoreau said it best in "[Civil Disobedience](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/71)" that:

> ”Petitions only strengthen the authority of the government by recognizing its authority and honoring the will of the majority. “[Any] man more right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one already,”

I'm in the stages of planning a route to walk. I haven't decided how far I will walk yet, how far as evil walked in our own lives? But my plan is to walk south toward the den of evil. I while ago I created a [decentralized community proposal](/proposals/proposal-decentralized-community) on how we can build a better life without these institutions running our lives.

See what you think, if you have suggestions on how we can build a better life by working together from a grassroots level and shed all centralized power structure institutional support or if you would like to support my efforts you can email me at scott@thisgreatwork.org
