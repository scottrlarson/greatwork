# The path of least resistance means the path with no conflict

Do not start a conflict with government or court officials. This how they act against you, by getting you to respond to conflict. You have to find a way to reframe your reactions when someone attempts to trigger a response in you. Otherwise you will fail to get what you want every time.

The universe only serves those who are able to remain calm and unresentful in the face of aggression. When you take a non-aggressive approach the wrong doer has no where to go, nothing to attack. This is similar to aikido, don't resist your opponents force. Yield to overcome. This does not mean let people walk all over you. You can stand your ground by not attacking. This is why its important to have something in writing that is calm cool and collective. When you keep coming back to your writing you let the person know that you wont be thrown off balance by emotion.
