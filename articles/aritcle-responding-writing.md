# Always respond in writing unless you need to further clarify or authenticate your written document with your voice. 

When dealing with government or court entities if you use your voice without a putting your premise in writing you are asking for trouble. Just remember these systems are not your friends, the might act against you and you need something to back you up in case an action gets taking against you.

Do not rely on court transcripts, most courts have no problem with striking something from the record.
If you get a call or an notice to appear in court, always inform the party that your method of communication is in writing. Get there address and respond in writing as soon as you can. Most government or court actions have a time limit to respond. 

Whenever you are asked to speak (by voice) on your behalf always reference your writing on the matter. Try to clarify your premise as few words as possible, don't ever go over a page of text unless its a really complicated issue, and even then you want to address one point per letter. Its slow but the details become lost in complicated matters if you try to handle more than one point per letter.

The are different kinds of communications to use depending on the situation:

- Standard Communication: a simple and polite letter asking for clarification or responding to one point.
- Notice: When you need to address interfering behavior or notify a man or a women on a position you have.
