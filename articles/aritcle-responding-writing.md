# Always respond in writing unless you need to further clarify or authenticate your written document with your voice. 

When dealing with government or court entities if you use your voice without a putting your premise in writing and that writing does not reach the intended audience you are asking for trouble. Just remember these systems are not your friends, the might act against you, and you need something in writing to back you up incase an action gets taking against you.

Do not rely on court transcripts, most courts have no problem with striking something from the record. Civil courts also can ignore court records because typical Civil court transcript records are part of the commerical system of the courts. As evidence, court transcripts can and do sometimes get ignored, or get disappeared.


If you get a call or an notice to appear in court, always inform the party that your method of communication is in writing. Get their address and respond in writing as soon as you can. Most government or court actions have a time limit to respond. Government actions by letter is usually 21 days. Court actions by writing are usually very short usually 72 hours. To respond to a deadline like this you might have to actually go down to the court and enter your paper work into the court record via the court cleark. Please be aware that the clearks know little or next to nothing about common law. They only follow instructions of their superiors. You might have trouble getting them to enter paper work if they are told not to enter something. Do not engage them when they are playing the role of a cleark in arguments about their job, inabilty to do their job or your rights. You want a cleark on your side. If you encounter trouble with a cleark interfearing with your ability to enter paper work into a court record you can always mail or fax the paper work in, in which case the cleark then has to enter it into the record. I have not seen a situation where paper work that was mailed or fax in was not entered in a court record. From my understanding, the clearks job is to enter paper work into a court record, not judge the validity of any paper work, but sometimes you get corrupt courts and corrupted people who get away with these crimes since they do not usually get held to account.

Additionally, think of court cases as a suit case. They packed that case, if they are taking action against you its their case. You cannot do anything to their case that they do not want you to do if they can get away with it. You can make your own case and hit them with an action but never try to protect your rights or bring an action against a party when the case doesnt belong to you. How to make your own case is outside of the scope of this article, I suggest you listen to the Karl Lentz on Angela's "My Privite Audio" talkshoes. Karl Letz goes into this isssue in pretty good detail. I forget which one.

Whenever you are asked to speak (by voice) on your behalf always reference your writing on the matter. And use as few vocal words as possible. Everything the courters say at court is a legal determination, and everything you say in the defendant role can be used against you in that legal determination. When writing your position and entering it into the court, clarify your premise as few words as possible, don't ever go over a page of text unless its a really complicated issue, and even then you want to address one point per letter. Its slow but the details become lost in complicated matters if you try to handle more than one point per letter.

When you are in court (and you dont want to be in court as a defendant but if you have to "Make a special appearanace" to answer a claim or complaint) stylize everything you say with your voice as a question because they have the authority if its Civil and its their case. Make sure you have something in writing before the court that you can reference. 

The are different kinds of communications to use depending on the situation:

- Standard Communication: a simple and polite letter asking for clarification or responding to one point.
- Notice: When you need to address interfering behavior or notify a man or a women on a position you have.

Make sure you learn [How to write a letter] before you go writing one, also make sure you are careful about the words you use. Use the [Online Etymology Dictionary] and look up important words, make sure that you use a a word that can't be taken out of context with a synomnyms. Many words have synomnymns to confuse the root meaning of a word. Courts use these words because they know the true meaning of a word and the public doesnt. This create power diffential between the courts and the pubic.
