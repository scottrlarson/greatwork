# Attitude determines outcomes

Your general attitude toward yourself and others can and will determine the outcome of every situation you find yourself in.

If in the past, you have harmed others, or you have been harmed and allow that harm to effect your attitude in the encounter with government or court officials then rest assured you will encounter difficulties when getting remedies for actions against your person. The universe can and does act against you for wrongs you have committed or if you haven't dealt with wrongs against you in a proper manner.

Also your conduct shows in each encounter with everyone you meet. This determines how people will an do treat you. Get right with yourself before working with this material as if you have issues that are acting against you nothing will help you until you address the underlying issues you have in your life.
