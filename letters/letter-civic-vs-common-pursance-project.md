# Open Letter to the Pursuance Project about the project's civil context 

**Context**  
*I watched the AMA video on https://pursuanceproject.org/ and wanted to see if I could make a case for dropping civil (Roman) concepts and ideologies in favor of common and grassroots concepts and ideologies.*

*The links to words are to the etymology online dictionary. Please consider the nouns vs the verbs when looking at the right context in which we come to an understanding. Roman law history has shown synonyms are typically used to obfuscate the true meaning of a particular word, at least when it comes to politics and government.*

Might I suggest that you consider that the word [civic](https://www.etymonline.com/word/civics) is related to "[govern(v)](https://www.etymonline.com/word/govern)" the science of government and that in this case, government means to [rule(v)](https://www.etymonline.com/word/rule) with authority.

[Authority](https://www.etymonline.com/word/authority) in the context of government means the right to rule(v). Now I ask you to consider that the right to "[rule(v)](https://www.etymonline.com/word/rule)" in the context of a verb "to control, guide, or direct" might not be what you want to convey as you go about creating a new platform to ultimately create freedom from tyranny a hold these tyrannical institutions accountable. Who has the right to rule you but you? Man may do things wrong and negatively impact society, but that does not give you the right to rule(v) over others. We can take action that is necessary to protect our rights, freedoms and property, but do we really have the right to rule(v) over another due to a wrong action?

Might I suggest that the word "[common(agj.)](https://www.etymonline.com/word/common)" is a better word and ideology to use in place of "civic"? [Man(n.)](https://www.etymonline.com/word/man) is fluid and dynamic, has rights to life, freedom and property until those rights conflict with another.

States are solid and unmovable, has duties and responsibilities to the people in which they serve. If we put Man into a state he becomes solid and unmovable, instead of fluid any dynamic.

Do we really want to make humans have states? Is this not the main problem of our current civil society? What has imposing unjust laws and regulations on Man done for us as a society? It seems to me that Man needs the environment to self-govern, then do we need civil institutions? What if all the wrongs that are cause by Man are related to regulation of Man using unjust civil law when its imposed on the actions of Man? 

Civil law came about in Roman times to handle issues of commerce during a time where common law was used to solve matters of Man. When you apply civil law to matters of men the state becomes the [arbiter(n)](https://www.etymonline.com/word/arbiter) of Man instead of our peers. Man then spends his life in a battle against his oppressors (The state) This [hegelian dialectic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic#Hegelian_dialectic) of duty to state versus right to life freedom and property (except when the rights of another are interfered with) [creates tyarnny](https://scottrlarson.github.io/activism/commonwealths/document/end-of-all-evil.html).
