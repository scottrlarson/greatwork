# Understanding the roles we play

## Courts

Think of a court of law or a court of record like a Sovereign [royal court.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_(royal)) In a Sovereign kingdom You usually have a King (Sovereign), a Queen, a Prince and so on.

Courts of law (Civil) and record(Common) are modeled after the royal court structure. The main rodles are: Judge/Justice, Jury,  and Clerks.

The kind of law (Civil) or (Common) is the rules a court operates under.

The jurisdiction of the court is the venue you are in. You could be at Queen Bench, a federal court, a state court, a city court, a county court etc... The venue you are at determines determine how the rules are setup. Notice I use "at" instead of "in" court. There is a big difference between those two words that I will get to.

### Civil
 
 A Civil law court typically is used to handle matters of commerce. Actually from the stand point of a Civil Jursidiction, quite a bit falls falls under commerce law, even criminal matters actually sometimes fall under commerce. 
 
 Civil law originated from Rome. Rome conquered many nations, they need a system of law to use when dealing with a populace that was not Roman and to handle disputes of commerce between Romans and non-romans.
 
 Civil law was typically applied by judges discretion. Meaning judges decided what the law was (with the help of experts of law) and applied the law how they saw fit under what was called public policy. Public policy was anything the judges thought was good to protect the balance between Romans and non-romans. It was not always fair, and the individuals never really had a say unless they were able to persuade a member of the court though a connect or something like that.
 
 ### Common
 
 Common law is based on the customs of a society. Customs usually came about from the Natural world of do unto others as you would like done to yourself.
 
 Over time case law derived from decisions based on customs of society built up over time. A judge or a justice, judges were called justices because they only passed down rulings based on customary law that were deemed just by the people.
 
Common or Customary law was used by Rome to handle issues of Romans, until Rome changed from a republic to a empire. Rome had Emperoors then and Emperors didnt like that their decisions could be countered by customary law. So Civil law started to take over as it was easier to apply and it allowed Emperors to handle disputes in a uniform fashion. The problem was that indivdual rights gave way to the needs of society. The emperors ruled there soceities in a way that didnt allow for much customary law.
 
Today Common law nations like the United States and England really use Civil law for most cases since it allows political governments to exercise power over its city-states. Common or Customary law is rarely used unless invoked by an individual.  Even then it may be difficult to invoke this type of law since most don't understand how it works or if it really exists. See [The Common Law and Civil Law Traditions] for more information.

But the reality is that we (as in the people) have customary law at our disposal. It really is suppose to be used to handle interference of our rights of mankind.

When a Police Officer (Really called Peace Keeper in Common/Customary Law) pulls you over for a traffic violation they are operating under Civil law even though they should be operating under both deeding on the situation.

Traveling from point A to point B on a public road is a Right. The people pay for the roads, and the peace keepers are put in place by the will of the people. But some how the situation got turned around. Peace Keepers rarely operate under the Peace Keeping flag and instead operate like salvors that see you as salvage that is adrift at sea. See [Marine salvage] for more information about this.
 
Understanding the role you play or at least understanding that Civil governmental entities might not see you as you see yourself is important because they might see you in a different light then you are used to. If you dont understand this you might get blind sided by some action they take because you assumed they see you as you see yourself.

In court what you say and the words you use determines how you will be perceived.

Remember that courts are put into place to serve the people and the public good, not to give a judge or a Judicial system license to interfere with your rights. In Natural Law we are consider self-determined, In Common/Customary Law our rights to life, freedom and property are paramount, in Civil Law society determines what your rights are. Its really up to you on how you want to be perceived. If you do not make a choice (with your actions) the choice will be made for you. If you don't want to deal with the world the way it is thats fine, just remember you might be treated like salvage and pay the consequences of being treated like salvage.

##Government

Government programs like The Internal Revenue Service (I.R.S) is exactly what the name implies. It is internal, it collects revenue from Tax Payers, and its a service that doesn't necessarily work for the people who put the government in place.

Since the I.R.S is not a person in order to interact with you they have to get you to assume a role like Tax Payer. The term "Tax Payer" is a fictitious entity. Its not really you, but they want you to respond to a letter that addresses you as something that you are not. Do not respond to letters that don't address you by name or ask for clarification on who the are trying to reach. Are you "Joe Silver" or "Tax Payer". Make a choice and stick with it. Never let an organization reduce you to a fictitious entity. You will regret it one day when you want them to see you as you want to be seen.
