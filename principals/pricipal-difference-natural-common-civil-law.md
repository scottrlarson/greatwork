# Understanding the difference between Natural, Common and Civil law

Please read the principal articles on [Natural](), [Common]() and [Civil]() law before delving into this article. The subject matter will assume you know what each of these topics mean.

## Natural law

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law

I call this Universal law, as I dont think there is a creator god in and of itself. More like there is a source of creation that sits outside our understanding.

But that does mean we cant understand its creation to a certian extent. If we look at Hermetics this practice teaches that there are laws we are all bound by. The one principal we are going to address here is the the principal of cause and effect. But there are many others. If you are interested in learning more about these principals please check out the book called "[The Kybilion]()" It is a great primer on hermetic teachings,

The pricipal of cause and effect states that for every cause in the universe there is any equal and opposite effect. Time plays a role but a very small one at best. Some people can get by for years or even centuries with out feeling any ill effects  of there actions, but sooner or later they will.

From my understanding time only appers lienier on earth. But outside of the dimension that earth is in everything that can happen, does happen non-leinierly.

Natural law means that if you act in a certain way you will experience the consequences of that act as an effect on yourself. How and when, is really a variable that is outside our ability to understand.  That is of course, unless you have some kind of special knowledge that most people don't have. There are always exceptions to rules, but they are difficult to know.

All you need to know right now about Natural law is it does have an effect on you whether you believe it or not, that effect can be unknowable, and the time and place is also outside of your ability to know. 

Please understand that:

1. In the realm of cause and effect there isn't any moral relativism.
2. If you conduct yourself badly in life you will feel the effects of that conduct.
3. Your ability to function or gain remedy may be effected by your previous conduct in life. This is one of the reasons why the application of law in a self-determined way works for some and not for others. If you haven't aligned yourself to the laws of the universe, there is no reason why any law will work for you. It will only work against you until you align your actions to the law.
