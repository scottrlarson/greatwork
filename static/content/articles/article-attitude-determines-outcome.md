# Attitude determines outcomes

Your general attitude toward yourself and others can and will determine the outcome of every situation you find yourself in.

If in the past, you have harmed others, or you have been harmed and allow that harm to effect your attitude in the encounter with government or court officials then rest assured you will encounter difficulties when getting remedies for actions against your person. The universe can and does act against you for wrongs you have committed or if you haven't dealt with wrongs against you in a proper manner.

Also your conduct shows in each encounter with everyone you meet. This determines how people will an do treat you. Get right with yourself first. If you have wrongs to right, or you have allowed yourself to be violated and have a beef against the world because of it, these events can and will work against you. Your emotions are silent commuicaton cues that people use to make determinations about your state of being. When people are not sure of your strength of character they will not help you. They will try to protect themselves against you creating conflict.
