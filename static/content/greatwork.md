# The Great Work

The Great Work is a collection of writings I made in an attempt to knowledgify the world on what it means to be a human being on the path of truth. There are many interpretations of what The Great Work means. My understanding is this: 

1. You want to do what is right
2. You learn how to do what is right
3. You act on what you know to be right

The Great Work involves gaining knowledge, expanding your being (awareness to act), teaching others, and acting in your own capcity to do what is right in the world. You can no longer stand by and watch evil happen to people without doing something about it, or you are moving toward that goal.

My goal in this particular expression of this work is to show what I have learned and express that knoweldge to the world.

These writings may be freely used and distributed as long as the context of the message remains intact.
