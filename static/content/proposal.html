 	<h3>A word from the author,</h3> 
 	<p>The Commonwealths proposal is a concept I put together from the help and assistance of many different people online and off to offer an alternative solution to the unlimited corruption we see in our current form of the united states government today. Although its based in the U.S., it can also be applied in any country on the earth for those who wish to rise up and challenge the status quo.</p> 
 	<p>This site is dedicated to helping humanity build strong local communities through the principals of self-government and self-organization. If any central government should exist, it should never be in a position of power to interfere with the rights, freedoms and property of the people in which it serves.</p> 
 	<p>Consider this when you are reading, writing and thinking about building or contributing to&nbsp; a new world for everyone.</p> <p>In natural great peace, from Scott : Larson.</p>
 	<h3>How our current form of government actual works</h3> 
 	<p>In the United States, the current form of society is based on polarization at the top of governing bodies such as the electorical collage between <a href="http://www.commonwealths.org/node/87/index.html">politic parties</a> democratic and repuliucan. &nbsp;This political process puts the decisions based upon majority rule above individual rights and freedoms. Decisions are made at the top, and results of those decisions trickle down to the people. Decision makers are encouraged and supported by our system of government to act for a small minority of people who control the government from the outside and those people get kickbacks when they play the game. The people playing this game have very little regard for how decisions impact the people. As laws are passed based on what the state is good for the people, and deals are made for the benefit of special interests at our expense, it becomes increasingly difficult to redress decisions after they become policy. Especially given the limited resources and awareness to monitor and act on an ever increasingly amount of these policies compared to special interests who have the advantage of unlimited resources and face time with our elected representatives. The system just doesn't work the way it was intended, its a top-down one way communication system.</p>
 	<p>Good governance is meant be handled at the grassroots level, if we want to have a balanced government it can only happen though the people on our level, if we allow <a href="http://www.commonwealths.org/node/87/index.html">political parties</a> that align themselves with the upper echelons of power to decide for us it will be very difficult to get governance to work for the people. When issues get polarized at the top that polorization distracts from the real issues that happen at the grass roots level. This prevents the people from handling issues that need governance from being hadled organically.</p> 
 	
 	<h3>What is the Commonwealths?</h3> 
 	<p>The Commonwealths is a proposal for a cooperative approach to operating a decentralized, trustworthy and balanced society. It's a set of communities containing free individuals who voluntarily participate in the operation of their own community, and when necessary cooperates between each non-local community within the Commonwealths at large for mutual benefit. The goal is to improve the quality of life of all individuals and reduce corruptive influences that make governing a society difficult by implementing strategies that create transparency in the operation of whats called "self-organized" societies. Self-organization means that everyone in the society contributes to the operation of that society in some way and those contributions are made transparent though web based technologies.</p> 
 	<p>Self-organization and self-governing are the key components to a decentralized horizontally run community where everyone plays a part in its direction.&nbsp; Projects and proposals that are introduced and implemented into the Commonwealths communities get rated and tracked by individuals in that community based on the benefit and cost it has on the community. In the Commonwealths, people, groups and ideas that benefit each community are tracked and accounted for by a set of principles called <a href="http://www.commonwealths.org/past">P.A.S.T</a> (Participatory, Accountable, Skillful and Trustworthy)&nbsp; The goal is to build a trust by using web based technologies to create a record of public service actions within each community. That way public attention is directed at community effecting decisions.</p> 
 	<p>When you want to have something done in the Commonwealths, your <a href="http://www.commonwealths.org/past">P.A.S.T</a>&nbsp; actions determine the level of trust people have in your ability to execute those projects or proposals. Each individual who is interested in project building has a profile containing a reputation page where the community can go to directly review or score your P.A.S.T actions. As people vouch for or question each others public service actions each profile accumulates a <a href="http://www.commonwealths.org/past">P.A.S.T</a> history that makes or breaks a individual's ability to operate effectively in the Commonwealths, or whether a project or proposal gets accepted or rejected.</p> <p>The web based system works though inner-connected websites that allow each individual to rate or score a everyone's public service actions. This prevents individual's from saying one thing and doing another since our words an actions are recorded within our profiles online. At the same time this system allows members with good intentions to earn the due respect they deserve when they act in the best interest of everyone.</div></div></fieldset> </div></form></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-supporting-evidence field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><form action="/" method="post" id="collapse-text-dynamic-form-number-2" accept-charset="UTF-8"><div><div class="collapse-text-text"><h3>How Our Current System of Society Based on Civil [roman] Law Prevents Change</h3> <ul> <li>From the 12th century on, the study of Roman Law started to be introduced in the faculties of Law in the universities of Europe.&nbsp;With the study of Roman Law, a completely different type of State was presented as ideal: A State that was no longer governed by customs, but rather by laws made by the State itself, which everyone had to obey. The people did not like these artificial laws. Nonetheless, the judges applied them since they deemed Roman Law to be much more sophisticated and academic than those simple laws generated by custom under the warmth of living practice. -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.traditioninaction.org/OrganicSociety/A_091_Customary_4.html">Modern Democracy vs. Customary Law</a><sup>a</sup></li> <li>Presidential <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVmsaDS_FwY" title="Elections can be rigged without your knowledge">elections can be fixed</a><sup>1</sup> by special interests <a href="http://youtu.be/S5ZRRimf3Ps" title="Preventing Ralph Nader from entering the debate">preventing candidates</a><sup>2</sup> that support real change from getting any <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iW5kOB1pmg#t=17" title="How search engines distort election candidate results.">real attention</a><sup>3</sup> or be able to <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2000/10/nad-o05.html">participate in the election process</a>.</li> <li>Our current democratic society doesn't work for us, it simply allows people with the most resources to make policy by using resources accumulated at the top to be put to use in convincing the public to go along with decisions that are based on self-interest.

If that sounds esoteric to you, it is because our world is being run by psychopaths that have the same esoteric knowledge but they are putting into practice to be used in convincing the people to go along with a totalitarian agenda, and acting in concert that prevents you from understanding this information. If you think that is crazy conspiracy nonsense then you can leave this website and believe whatever you want to believe while the world gets worse.

We have to effect change on the level of Natural Law. Once enough people are in alignment with it our external world will change on its own.</p> <p>Please be aware that the subject of natural law appears antagonistic to a lot of people on that planet. I believe that there is a part of every human being that is angry and upset that we have allowed the problems of the world to come this far and that to face that truth that we are responsible through our ignorance or our unwillingness to do anything about it is the part that feels antagonistic. Its not the subject matter or the presenter per say but the actions that put the road blocks to this subject that is causing the antagonistic feelings. Try to stick with it, it will get easier as you get though the material. Humanity has been duped into false belief systems for a very long time, and those belief systems are operating on full cylinders now.

Instead of petitioning the government to dissolve the Union with slaveholders, Thoreau believed those reformers should dissolve “the union between themselves and the State – and refuse to pay their quota into its treasury<strong>.” Petitions only strengthened the authority of the government by recognizing its authority and honoring the will of the majority. “[Any] man more right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one already,” </strong>he observes. </em><br><em><strong>The reformers who petition government for permission “love better to talk” about justice than to act on it. </strong>Thus, Thoreau concludes<strong>, “Reform keeps many scores of newspapers in its service, but not one man.” To men who prefer a safe strategy, voting becomes a substitute for action and politics becomes a sort of game, like checkers or backgammon, only with a slight moral tinge. </strong></em><br><em>To Thoreau<strong>, anyone willing to leave moral decisions to the will of the majority is not really concerned that right should prevail. </strong>When resisting the poll tax, he did not consult the majority; he acted. If he had allowed the majority to decide whether or not he should pay, by his own standards he would have shown no regard for what is right.</em></p> </div><fieldset class="collapse-text-fieldset collapsible collapsed collapse-text-default-title form-wrapper"><legend><span class="fieldset-legend">Click here to expand or collapse this section</span></legend><div class="fieldset-wrapper"><div class="collapse-text-text"><em><strong>[51] Moreover, Thoreau considers voting to be a poor vehicle for reform because voting follows real change; it does not precede or cause it. “When the majority shall at length vote for the abolition of slavery,” he writes, “it will be because they are indifferent to slavery, or because there is but little slavery left to be abolished by their vote.” As for the other means that the state provides for changes to itself, they are extraordinarily slow. Thoreau notes, “They take too much time, and a man’s life will be gone.” <br></strong></em></p> <p>Currently, the U.S operates with a top-down approach to governance, this appears to weaken communities. Instead of fighting corruption what we need to do is to build a new decentralized structure of society that sidesteps our current political climate, and give people a vision of how a different model could benefit all of us.</div></div></fieldset> <div class="collapse-text-text"> <p><a href="http://www.thoreausociety.org/life-legacy">Henry Thoreau Life and Legacy</a></p></div></div></form></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-contact-information field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><h3>Supporting Information</h3> <p>For more information on the Commonwealths please have a look at our <a href="http://www.commonwealths.org/operations">Operational Goals</a>.
