**Naturallaw** ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language")[*iusnaturale*][philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy")that certain rights are inherent by virtue of [humannature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nature "Human nature") endowedby [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature "Nature"),[God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God "God"), or a [transcendent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence_%28religion%29 "Transcendence (religion)") source, and can be understood universally through [humanreason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_reason "Human reason").Historically, natural law refers to the use of reason toanalyze [humannature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nature "Human nature") [deduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning") binding rules of moral behavior from nature's or God's creation of [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality "Reality") and [mankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human "Human"). The **law of nature**, as determined bynature, is universal.^[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law#cite_note-IESS-1)^Natural law first appeared in [ancient Greekphilosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_philosophy "Ancient Greek philosophy"),^[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law#cite_note-2)^ andwas referred to by [Romanphilosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_philosopher "Roman philosopher") [Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero "Cicero").It was subsequently alluded to inthe [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible "Bible"),and was then developed in the [MiddleAges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages") by [Catholicphilosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_philosopher "Catholic philosopher") suchas [Albert theGreat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_the_Great "Albert the Great"),and [ThomasAquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas").During the [Age ofEnlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment"),modern natural law theories were further developed, combininginspiration from the [Romanlaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_law "Roman law"), andalongside philosophies like [socialcontract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract "Social contract") theory.It featured greatly in the worksof [AlbericoGentili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberico_Gentili "Alberico Gentili"), [FranciscoSuárez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Su%C3%A1rez "Francisco Suárez"), [RichardHooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hooker "Richard Hooker"), [ThomasHobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes "Thomas Hobbes"), [HugoGrotius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Grotius "Hugo Grotius"), [SamuelvonPufendorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_von_Pufendorf "Samuel von Pufendorf"), [MatthewHale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hale_%28jurist%29 "Matthew Hale (jurist)"), [JohnLocke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke "John Locke"), [FrancisHutcheson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Hutcheson_%28philosopher%29 "Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)"), [JeanJacquesBurlamaqui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Jacques_Burlamaqui "Jean Jacques Burlamaqui"), [JeanJacquesRousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Jacques_Rousseau "Jean Jacques Rousseau"), [EmmerichdeVattel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmerich_de_Vattel "Emmerich de Vattel"), [CesareBeccaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Beccaria "Cesare Beccaria") and [FrancescoMarioPagano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Mario_Pagano "Francesco Mario Pagano").It was used to challenge the [divine rightofkings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings "Divine right of kings"),and became an alternative justification for the establishment ofa [socialcontract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract "Social contract"), [positivelaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_law "Positive law"),and [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government "Government") --and thus legal rights -- in the formof [classicalrepublicanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_republicanism "Classical republicanism").Conversely, the concept of natural rights is used by others tochallenge the legitimacy of all such establishments. Contemporarily, the concept of natural law is closely related to theconcept of [naturalrights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rights "Natural rights").Indeed,many [philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher "Philosopher"), [jurists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist "Jurist") andscholars use natural law synonymously with natural rights([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): [*[iusnaturale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ius_naturale "Ius naturale")*]{style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"lang="la"}), or [naturaljustice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_justice "Natural justice").^[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law#cite_note-Shellens-3)^ whileothers distinguish between natural law and naturalright.^[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law#cite_note-IESS-1)^ [Declarationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarationism "Declarationism"),a [legalphilosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_law "Philosophy of law") thatis considered to violate the [SupremacyClause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause "Supremacy Clause") andthe [Anti-EstablishmentClause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause "Establishment Clause") ofthe [United StatesConstitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution "United States Constitution"),argues that the founding of the United States is based on natural law.Because of the intersection between natural lawand [naturalrights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights "Natural and legal rights"),natural law has been cited as a component inthe [United States Declaration ofIndependence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence "United States Declaration of Independence"),and claimed by natural law proponents thus to be incorporated into itsconstitution, as well as inthe [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France") *[Declarationof the Rights of Man and of theCitizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen "Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen")* (1789).(See: \"Laws of Nature\" First Paragraph Declaration ofIndependence^[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law#cite_note-4)^) Although natural law is often confusedwith [commonlaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law "Common law"), the twoare distinct. Even though natural law theories have exercised aprofound influence on the developmentof [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_law "English law") commonlaw,^[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law#cite_note-Blackstone-5)^ thelatter is not based on inherent rights, but is the legal traditionwhereby certain rights or values are legally recognized by virtue ofalready having judicial recognition orarticulation.^[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law#cite_note-Edlin-6)^ Naturallaw is often contrasted with the human-made laws ([positivelaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_law "Positive law")) of agiven [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_%28polity%29 "State (polity)"),political entityor [society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society "Society").^[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law#cite_note-7)^ Inlegal theory, the interpretation of a human-made law requires somereference to natural law. On this understanding of natural law,natural law can be invoked to criticize judicial decisions about whatthe law says, but not to criticize the best interpretation of the lawitself.
