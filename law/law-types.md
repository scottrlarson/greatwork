# Types of Law

## Natural Law

Universal, non-man made, binding and immutable conditions that govern the consequences of behavior.

## Common Law

Customary law that is derrived from the customs of a particular society. Common law is based on Natural/Universal law. The basic premise is do unto others as you want to be done unto you. 

## Civil Law 

Civil [Roman] law is the group of legal ideas and systems ultimately derived from the Roman Empire. Its very differnt from Common/Customary Law in that the Emperors of Rome, after they came to power when the Republic was abolished or being abolished determined what was law. This came about when Rome started to have problems tring to apply their customary law to non-roman cultures that were brought under Roman rule. At first Civil law was used only for matters of controversy in commerce, but eventually Civil law was applied to private controversies. This caused a great divide as the law steered away from Natural law into internal decisions from ruling classes that created a power differential between the ruling class and the people.

Deciding points of law in a Civil context became the de facto standard in Europe and its being applied to many matters in common law countries like England and America.
